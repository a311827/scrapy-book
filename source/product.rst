Main Features
==================

This topic briefly describes the main features of Zen Cloud Live Service (**ZenLive**).

Stream Pushing
---------------

ZenLive supports multiple modes to authenticate push streams. ZenLive allows you to push streams over Real-Time Messaging Protocol (**RTMP**) and pull streams from the Internet over multiple protocols. You can push streams from PCs, mobile phones, capture devices, and smart terminals.

Real-time Transcoding
-------------------------

ZenLive supports real-time transcoding of live streams between multiple bitrates and resolutions ranging from standard definition to high definition. You can add watermarks to original videos and content of different bitrates and resolutions. Audio and video data can be transcoded independently.

Content Security
-------------------------

ZenLive intelligently detects illegal content such as pornographic, violent, and terrorism-related content that is broadcast during live streaming. When such content is detected in live streams, ZenLive automatically sends alerts and allows you to block the streams with one click.

Live Stream Distribution And Playback
-------------------------

ZenLive allows you to configure URL whitelists and blacklists and enable anti-leeching. ZenLive provides multiple business-oriented modes to authenticate playback requests. ZenLive supports the playback of streams over RTMP, Flash Video (FLV), and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).

Video Stream Management
-------------------------

ZenLive supports live streaming space management. You can query the information and status of real-time streams and historical streams. You can also block a stream by adding it to the blacklist.

Console
-------------------------

The ZenLive console allows you to manage the global settings for your live streaming space, query and monitor the status of live streams, and collect statistics about the uplink and downlink bandwidth, traffic, and online viewers.
